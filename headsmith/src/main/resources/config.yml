# HeadSmith Configuration

# Exclude specific tags from loading.
# Tags are derived from file paths: heads/alphabet/oak.yml -> "alphabet/oak"
# Excluding a parent tag also excludes children (e.g., "alphabet" excludes all alphabet heads)
excluded-tags:
  # - alphabet/oak
  # - alphabet

# Exclude specific head IDs from loading
excluded-heads:
  # - candle
  # - stack_of_books

# Custom head files to load from the plugin data folder
# These are user-created files, not bundled in the JAR
custom-head-files:
  # - custom/my-heads.yml
